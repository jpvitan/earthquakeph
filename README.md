## Issues


### Internet Service Provider


#### PLDT and Smart Communications


Customers of PLDT and Smart Communications in the Philippines may face issues when installing or visiting sites hosted on Netlify. Unfortunately, this problem lies with the said ISPs, and the developer canâ€™t offer a permanent fix as of this writing. Changing your DNS setting to use Google Public DNS may temporarily resolve the issue.
